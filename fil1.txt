(UK and Australia) or "interlocking tower" (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station
areas were commonly routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause
some of the adjacent wires to 'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until
the gradual introduction of colour-light signals from the mid 20th century. Semaphore signals may also be operated by
electric motors, hydraulically or pneumatically, allowing them to be located further from the controlling signal box. In
some cases, they can be made to work automatically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power is lost or
a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores this
requires the spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; this is one of the reasons
for the widespread switch to upper quadrant signals. The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down
the post of a semaphore signal is actually to ensure the signal wire returns to its normal position when the controlling
