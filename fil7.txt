If someone requests a room and the current value of the semaphore is 0,[3] they are forced to wait until a room is freed
(when the count is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any
method can be used to select the one who will occupy the room (like FIFO or randomly picking one). And of course, a student
needs to inform the clerk about releasing their room only after really leaving it, otherwise, there can be an awkward
situation when such student is in the process of leaving the room (they are packing their textbooks, etc.) and another
student enters the room before they leave it. When used to control access to a pool of resources, a semaphore tracks only
how many resources are free; it does not keep track of which of the resources are free. Some other mechanism (possibly
involving more semaphores) may be required to select a particular free resource. The paradigm is especially powerful
because the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions. The librarian above may turn
the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining, or may place a sign that says the rooms are very
