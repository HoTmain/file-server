Railway semaphore signal is one of the earliest forms of fixed railway signals. This semaphore system involves signals that
display their different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of inclination of a pivoted 'arm'. Semaphore
signals were patented in the early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens, and soon became the most widely used form of mechanical
signal. Designs have altered over the intervening years, and colour light signals have replaced semaphore signals in most
countries, but in a few they remain in use. The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the
London and Croydon Railway (later the London Brighton and South Coast Railway) at New Cross, southeast London, about 1842
on the newly enlarged layout also accommodating the South Eastern Railway. John Urpeth Rastrick claimed to have suggested
the idea to Hutton Gregory. Worldwide, the first semaphore signals were controlled by levers situated at the signals.
Some early signals protruded from the roof of the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers
connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires (Continental Europe), or pipes supported on rollers (US).
