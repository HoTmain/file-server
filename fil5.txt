is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores
spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; this is one of the reasons for the
upper quadrant signals. (The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down the post of a semaphore
ensure the signal wire returns to its normal position when the controlling lever is put back. Otherwise, again, the signal
return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.)
The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as fixed manual signals throughout Britain and the United States superseding
in most uses by 1870. Such signals as electrically operated automatic and interlocking signals were widely adopted in the

manual semaphores and earlier electric disc signals quickly began to disappear. In computer science, a semaphore is a
variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads
