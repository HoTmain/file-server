Railway semaphore signal is one of the earliest forms of fixed railway signals. This semaphore system involves signals that display their
different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of inclination of a pivoted 'arm'. Semaphore signals were patented in the
early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens, and soon became the most widely used form of mechanical signal. Designs have altered over the
intervening years, and colour light signals have replaced semaphore signals in most countries, but in a few they remain in use.
The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the London and Croydon Railway (later the London Brighton and
South Coast Railway) at New Cross, southeast London, about 1842 on the newly enlarged layout also accommodating the South Eastern Railway.
John Urpeth Rastrick claimed to have suggested the idea to Hutton Gregory.
Worldwide, the first semaphore signals were controlled by levers situated at the signals. Some early signals protruded from the roof of
the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires
(Continental Europe), or pipes supported on rollers (US). The levers were grouped together in a building known as a "signal box"
(UK and Australia) or "interlocking tower" (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly
routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause some of the adjacent wires to
'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light
signals from the mid 20th century.
Semaphore signals may also be operated by electric motors, hydraulically or pneumatically, allowing them to be located further from the
controlling signal box. In some cases, they can be made to work automatically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power
is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores this requires the
spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; this is one of the reasons for the widespread switch to
upper quadrant signals. (The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down the post of a semaphore signal is actually to
ensure the signal wire returns to its normal position when the controlling lever is put back. Otherwise, again, the signal could fail to
return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.)
The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as fixed manual signals throughout Britain and the United States superseding all other types
in most uses by 1870. Such signals as electrically operated automatic and interlocking signals were widely adopted in the U.S. After 1908
with the advent of the Union Switch & Signals "Stye's "B" & "S" and the General Railway Signal Company's universal Model 2A mechanisms
manual semaphores and earlier electric disc signals quickly began to disappear.
In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads
and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphores are a type of
synchronization primitive. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled)
depending on programmer-defined conditions.
A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in a real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are
available, coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e., to avoid race conditions) as units are acquired or become free,
and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.
Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions; however, their use is not a guarantee that a program is free from these
problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to the
values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.
The semaphore concept was invented by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1962 or 1963,[2] when Dijkstra and his team were
developing an operating system for the Electrologica X8. That system eventually became known as THE multiprogramming system.
Suppose a library has 10 identical study rooms, to be used by one student at a time. Students must request a room from the front desk if
they wish to use a study room. If no rooms are free, students wait at the desk until someone relinquishes a room. When a student has
finished using a room, the student must return to the desk and indicate that one room has become free.
In the simplest implementation, the clerk at the front desk knows only the number of free rooms available, which they only know correctly
if all of the students actually use their room while they have signed up for them and return them when they're done. When a student
requests a room, the clerk decreases this number. When a student releases a room, the clerk increases this number. The room can be used
for as long as desired, and so it is not possible to book rooms ahead of time.
In this scenario the front desk count-holder represents a counting semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent
processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in this scenario is initially 10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room,
they are granted access, and the value of the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next student comes, it drops to 8, then 7 and so on.
If someone requests a room and the current value of the semaphore is 0,[3] they are forced to wait until a room is freed (when the count
is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used to select the
one who will occupy the room (like FIFO or randomly picking one). And of course, a student needs to inform the clerk about releasing their
room only after really leaving it, otherwise, there can be an awkward situation when such student is in the process of leaving the room
(they are packing their textbooks, etc.) and another student enters the room before they leave it.
When used to control access to a pool of resources, a semaphore tracks only how many resources are free; it does not keep track of which
of the resources are free. Some other mechanism (possibly involving more semaphores) may be required to select a particular free resource.
The paradigm is especially powerful because the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions.
The librarian above may turn the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining, or may place a sign that says the
rooms are very busy when most of the rooms are occupied.
The success of the protocol requires applications to follow it correctly. Fairness and safety are likely to be compromised
(which practically means a program may behave slowly, act erratically, hang or crash) if even a single process acts incorrectly. This
includes:
requesting a resource and forgetting to release it;
releasing a resource that was never requested;
holding a resource for a long time without needing it;
using a resource without requesting it first (or after releasing it).
Even if all processes follow these rules, multi-resource deadlock may still occur when there are different resources managed by different
semaphores and when processes need to use more than one resource at a time, as illustrated by the dining philosophers problem.
Counting semaphores are equipped with two operations, historically denoted as P and V (see § Operation names for alternative names).
Operation V increments the semaphore S, and operation P decrements it.
The value of the semaphore S is the number of units of the resource that are currently available. The P operation wastes time or sleeps
until a resource protected by the semaphore becomes available, at which time the resource is immediately claimed. The V operation is the
inverse: it makes a resource available again after the process has finished using it. One important property of semaphore S is that its
value cannot be changed except by using the V and P operations.
A simple way to understand wait (P) and signal (V) operations is:
wait: Decrements the value of semaphore variable by 1. If the new value of the semaphore variable is negative, the process executing wait
is blocked (i.e., added to the semaphore's queue). Otherwise, the process continues execution, having used a unit of the resource.
signal: Increments the value of semaphore variable by 1. After the increment, if the pre-increment value was negative (meaning there are
processes waiting for a resource), it transfers a blocked process from the semaphore's waiting queue to the ready queue.
Many operating systems provide efficient semaphore primitives that unblock a waiting process when the semaphore is incremented. This means
that processes do not waste time checking the semaphore value unnecessarily.
The counting semaphore concept can be extended with the ability to claim or return more than one "unit" from the semaphore, a technique
implemented in Unix. The modified V and P operations are as follows, using square brackets to indicate atomic operations, i.e., operations
which appear indivisible from the perspective of other processes:

is blocked (i.e., added to the semaphore's queue). Otherwise, the process continues execution, having used a unit of the resource.
signal: Increments the value of semaphore variable by 1. After the increment, if the pre-increment value was negative (meaning there are
processes waiting for a resource), it transfers a blocked process from the semaphore's waiting queue to the ready queue.
Many operating systems provide efficient semaphore primitives that unblock a waiting process when the semaphore is incremented. This means
that processes do not waste time checking the semaphore value unnecessarily.
The counting semaphore concept can be extended with the ability to claim or return more than one "unit" from the semaphore, a technique
implemented in Unix. The modified V and P operations are as follows, using square brackets to indicate atomic operations, i.e., operations
which appear indivisible from the perspective of other processes:
Railway semaphore signal is one of the earliest forms of fixed railway signals. This semaphore system involves signals that display their
different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of inclination of a pivoted 'arm'. Semaphore signals were patented in the
early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens, and soon became the most widely used form of mechanical signal. Designs have altered over the
intervening years, and colour light signals have replaced semaphore signals in most countries, but in a few they remain in use.
The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the London and Croydon Railway (later the London Brighton and
South Coast Railway) at New Cross, southeast London, about 1842 on the newly enlarged layout also accommodating the South Eastern Railway.
John Urpeth Rastrick claimed to have suggested the idea to Hutton Gregory.
Worldwide, the first semaphore signals were controlled by levers situated at the signals. Some early signals protruded from the roof of
the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires
(Continental Europe), or pipes supported on rollers (US). The levers were grouped together in a building known as a "signal box"
(UK and Australia) or "interlocking tower" (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly
routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause some of the adjacent wires to
'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light
signals from the mid 20th century.
Semaphore signals may also be operated by electric motors, hydraulically or pneumatically, allowing them to be located further from the
controlling signal box. In some cases, they can be made to work automatically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power
is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores this requires the
spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; this is one of the reasons for the widespread switch to
upper quadrant signals. (The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down the post of a semaphore signal is actually to
ensure the signal wire returns to its normal position when the controlling lever is put back. Otherwise, again, the signal could fail to
return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.)
The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as fixed manual signals throughout Britain and the United States superseding all other types
in most uses by 1870. Such signals as electrically operated automatic and interlocking signals were widely adopted in the U.S. After 1908
with the advent of the Union Switch & Signals "Stye's "B" & "S" and the General Railway Signal Company's universal Model 2A mechanisms
manual semaphores and earlier electric disc signals quickly began to disappear.
In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads
and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphores are a type of
synchronization primitive. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled)
depending on programmer-defined conditions.
A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in a real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are
available, coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e., to avoid race conditions) as units are acquired or become free,
and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.
Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions; however, their use is not a guarantee that a program is free from these
problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to the
values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.
The semaphore concept was invented by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1962 or 1963,[2] when Dijkstra and his team were
developing an operating system for the Electrologica X8. That system eventually became known as THE multiprogramming system.
Suppose a library has 10 identical study rooms, to be used by one student at a time. Students must request a room from the front desk if
they wish to use a study room. If no rooms are free, students wait at the desk until someone relinquishes a room. When a student has
finished using a room, the student must return to the desk and indicate that one room has become free.
In the simplest implementation, the clerk at the front desk knows only the number of free rooms available, which they only know correctly
if all of the students actually use their room while they have signed up for them and return them when they're done. When a student
requests a room, the clerk decreases this number. When a student releases a room, the clerk increases this number. The room can be used
for as long as desired, and so it is not possible to book rooms ahead of time.
In this scenario the front desk count-holder represents a counting semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent
processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in this scenario is initially 10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room,
they are granted access, and the value of the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next student comes, it drops to 8, then 7 and so on.
If someone requests a room and the current value of the semaphore is 0,[3] they are forced to wait until a room is freed (when the count
is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used to select the
one who will occupy the room (like FIFO or randomly picking one). And of course, a student needs to inform the clerk about releasing their
room only after really leaving it, otherwise, there can be an awkward situation when such student is in the process of leaving the room
(they are packing their textbooks, etc.) and another student enters the room before they leave it.
When used to control access to a pool of resources, a semaphore tracks only how many resources are free; it does not keep track of which
of the resources are free. Some other mechanism (possibly involving more semaphores) may be required to select a particular free resource.
The paradigm is especially powerful because the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions.
The librarian above may turn the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining, or may place a sign that says the
rooms are very busy when most of the rooms are occupied.
The success of the protocol requires applications to follow it correctly. Fairness and safety are likely to be compromised
(which practically means a program may behave slowly, act erratically, hang or crash) if even a single process acts incorrectly. This
includes:
requesting a resource and forgetting to release it;
releasing a resource that was never requested;
holding a resource for a long time without needing it;
using a resource without requesting it first (or after releasing it).
Even if all processes follow these rules, multi-resource deadlock may still occur when there are different resources managed by different
semaphores and when processes need to use more than one resource at a time, as illustrated by the dining philosophers problem.
Counting semaphores are equipped with two operations, historically denoted as P and V (see § Operation names for alternative names).
Operation V increments the semaphore S, and operation P decrements it.
The value of the semaphore S is the number of units of the resource that are currently available. The P operation wastes time or sleeps
until a resource protected by the semaphore becomes available, at which time the resource is immediately claimed. The V operation is the
inverse: it makes a resource available again after the process has finished using it. One important property of semaphore S is that its
value cannot be changed except by using the V and P operations.
A simple way to understand wait (P) and signal (V) operations is:
wait: Decrements the value of semaphore variable by 1. If the new value of the semaphore variable is negative, the process executing wait
is blocked (i.e., added to the semaphore's queue). Otherwise, the process continues execution, having used a unit of the resource.

Even if all processes follow these rules, multi-resource deadlock may still occur when there are different resources managed by different
semaphores and when processes need to use more than one resource at a time, as illustrated by the dining philosophers problem.
Counting semaphores are equipped with two operations, historically denoted as P and V (see § Operation names for alternative names).
Operation V increments the semaphore S, and operation P decrements it.
The value of the semaphore S is the number of units of the resource that are currently available. The P operation wastes time or sleeps
until a resource protected by the semaphore becomes available, at which time the resource is immediately claimed. The V operation is the
inverse: it makes a resource available again after the process has finished using it. One important property of semaphore S is that its
value cannot be changed except by using the V and P operations.
A simple way to understand wait (P) and signal (V) operations is:
wait: Decrements the value of semaphore variable by 1. If the new value of the semaphore variable is negative, the process executing wait
is blocked (i.e., added to the semaphore's queue). Otherwise, the process continues execution, having used a unit of the resource.
signal: Increments the value of semaphore variable by 1. After the increment, if the pre-increment value was negative (meaning there are
processes waiting for a resource), it transfers a blocked process from the semaphore's waiting queue to the ready queue.
Many operating systems provide efficient semaphore primitives that unblock a waiting process when the semaphore is incremented. This means
that processes do not waste time checking the semaphore value unnecessarily.
The counting semaphore concept can be extended with the ability to claim or return more than one "unit" from the semaphore, a technique
implemented in Unix. The modified V and P operations are as follows, using square brackets to indicate atomic operations, i.e., operations

Railway semaphore signal is one of the earliest forms of fixed railway signals. This semaphore system involves signals that display their
different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of inclination of a pivoted 'arm'. Semaphore signals were patented in the
early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens, and soon became the most widely used form of mechanical signal. Designs have altered over the
intervening years, and colour light signals have replaced semaphore signals in most countries, but in a few they remain in use.
The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the London and Croydon Railway (later the London Brighton and
South Coast Railway) at New Cross, southeast London, about 1842 on the newly enlarged layout also accommodating the South Eastern Railway.
John Urpeth Rastrick claimed to have suggested the idea to Hutton Gregory.
Worldwide, the first semaphore signals were controlled by levers situated at the signals. Some early signals protruded from the roof of
the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires
(Continental Europe), or pipes supported on rollers (US). The levers were grouped together in a building known as a "signal box"
(UK and Australia) or "interlocking tower" (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly
routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause some of the adjacent wires to
'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light
signals from the mid 20th century.
Semaphore signals may also be operated by electric motors, hydraulically or pneumatically, allowing them to be located further from the
controlling signal box. In some cases, they can be made to work automatically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power
is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores this requires the
spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; this is one of the reasons for the widespread switch to
upper quadrant signals. (The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down the post of a semaphore signal is actually to
ensure the signal wire returns to its normal position when the controlling lever is put back. Otherwise, again, the signal could fail to
return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.)
The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as fixed manual signals throughout Britain and the United States superseding all other types
in most uses by 1870. Such signals as electrically operated automatic and interlocking signals were widely adopted in the U.S. After 1908
with the advent of the Union Switch & Signals "Stye's "B" & "S" and the General Railway Signal Company's universal Model 2A mechanisms
manual semaphores and earlier electric disc signals quickly began to disappear.
In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads
and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphores are a type of
synchronization primitive. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled)
depending on programmer-defined conditions.
A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in a real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are
available, coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e., to avoid race conditions) as units are acquired or become free,
and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.
Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions; however, their use is not a guarantee that a program is free from these
problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to the
values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.
The semaphore concept was invented by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1962 or 1963,[2] when Dijkstra and his team were
developing an operating system for the Electrologica X8. That system eventually became known as THE multiprogramming system.
Suppose a library has 10 identical study rooms, to be used by one student at a time. Students must request a room from the front desk if
they wish to use a study room. If no rooms are free, students wait at the desk until someone relinquishes a room. When a student has
finished using a room, the student must return to the desk and indicate that one room has become free.
In the simplest implementation, the clerk at the front desk knows only the number of free rooms available, which they only know correctly
if all of the students actually use their room while they have signed up for them and return them when they're done. When a student
requests a room, the clerk decreases this number. When a student releases a room, the clerk increases this number. The room can be used
for as long as desired, and so it is not possible to book rooms ahead of time.
In this scenario the front desk count-holder represents a counting semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent
processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in this scenario is initially 10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room,
they are granted access, and the value of the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next student comes, it drops to 8, then 7 and so on.
If someone requests a room and the current value of the semaphore is 0,[3] they are forced to wait until a room is freed (when the count
is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used to select the
one who will occupy the room (like FIFO or randomly picking one). And of course, a student needs to inform the clerk about releasing their
room only after really leaving it, otherwise, there can be an awkward situation when such student is in the process of leaving the room
(they are packing their textbooks, etc.) and another student enters the room before they leave it.
When used to control access to a pool of resources, a semaphore tracks only how many resources are free; it does not keep track of which
of the resources are free. Some other mechanism (possibly involving more semaphores) may be required to select a particular free resource.
The paradigm is especially powerful because the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions.
The librarian above may turn the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining, or may place a sign that says the
rooms are very busy when most of the rooms are occupied.
The success of the protocol requires applications to follow it correctly. Fairness and safety are likely to be compromised
(which practically means a program may behave slowly, act erratically, hang or crash) if even a single process acts incorrectly. This
includes:
requesting a resource and forgetting to release it;
releasing a resource that was never requested;
holding a resource for a long time without needing it;
using a resource without requesting it first (or after releasing it).
Even if all processes follow these rules, multi-resource deadlock may still occur when there are different resources managed by different

signal: Increments the value of semaphore variable by 1. After the increment, if the pre-increment value was negative (meaning there are
processes waiting for a resource), it transfers a blocked process from the semaphore's waiting queue to the ready queue.
Many operating systems provide efficient semaphore primitives that unblock a waiting process when the semaphore is incremented. This means
that processes do not waste time checking the semaphore value unnecessarily.
The counting semaphore concept can be extended with the ability to claim or return more than one "unit" from the semaphore, a technique
implemented in Unix. The modified V and P operations are as follows, using square brackets to indicate atomic operations, i.e., operations
which appear indivisible from the perspective of other processes:
Railway semaphore signal is one of the earliest forms of fixed railway signals. This semaphore system involves signals that display their
different indications to train drivers by changing the angle of inclination of a pivoted 'arm'. Semaphore signals were patented in the
early 1840s by Joseph James Stevens, and soon became the most widely used form of mechanical signal. Designs have altered over the
intervening years, and colour light signals have replaced semaphore signals in most countries, but in a few they remain in use.
The first railway semaphore signal was erected by Charles Hutton Gregory on the London and Croydon Railway (later the London Brighton and
South Coast Railway) at New Cross, southeast London, about 1842 on the newly enlarged layout also accommodating the South Eastern Railway.
John Urpeth Rastrick claimed to have suggested the idea to Hutton Gregory.
Worldwide, the first semaphore signals were controlled by levers situated at the signals. Some early signals protruded from the roof of
the controlling signal box. Later, remote operation was effected by levers connected to the signal by single wires (UK), pairs of wires
(Continental Europe), or pipes supported on rollers (US). The levers were grouped together in a building known as a "signal box"
(UK and Australia) or "interlocking tower" (US). In the UK multiple signal wires were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly
routed beneath platform faces just above rail level. The operation of a single signal wire would cause some of the adjacent wires to
'jangle', and this noise was one of the many characteristic sounds of railway travel until the gradual introduction of colour-light
signals from the mid 20th century.
Semaphore signals may also be operated by electric motors, hydraulically or pneumatically, allowing them to be located further from the
controlling signal box. In some cases, they can be made to work automatically. The signals are designed to be fail-safe so that if power
is lost or a linkage is broken, the arm will move by gravity into the horizontal position. For lower quadrant semaphores this requires the
spectacle case to be sufficiently heavy to ensure the arm rises rather than falls; this is one of the reasons for the widespread switch to
upper quadrant signals. (The purpose of the balance weight often found on a lever lower down the post of a semaphore signal is actually to
ensure the signal wire returns to its normal position when the controlling lever is put back. Otherwise, again, the signal could fail to
return to danger. These counterweights are used just as commonly on upper- as on lower-quadrant signals.)
The semaphore was afterwards rapidly adopted as fixed manual signals throughout Britain and the United States superseding all other types
in most uses by 1870. Such signals as electrically operated automatic and interlocking signals were widely adopted in the U.S. After 1908
with the advent of the Union Switch & Signals "Stye's "B" & "S" and the General Railway Signal Company's universal Model 2A mechanisms
manual semaphores and earlier electric disc signals quickly began to disappear.
In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple threads
and avoid critical section problems in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphores are a type of
synchronization primitive. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled)
depending on programmer-defined conditions.
A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in a real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are
available, coupled with operations to adjust that record safely (i.e., to avoid race conditions) as units are acquired or become free,
and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.
Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions; however, their use is not a guarantee that a program is free from these
problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while semaphores which are restricted to the
values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores and are used to implement locks.
The semaphore concept was invented by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1962 or 1963,[2] when Dijkstra and his team were
developing an operating system for the Electrologica X8. That system eventually became known as THE multiprogramming system.
Suppose a library has 10 identical study rooms, to be used by one student at a time. Students must request a room from the front desk if
they wish to use a study room. If no rooms are free, students wait at the desk until someone relinquishes a room. When a student has
finished using a room, the student must return to the desk and indicate that one room has become free.
In the simplest implementation, the clerk at the front desk knows only the number of free rooms available, which they only know correctly
if all of the students actually use their room while they have signed up for them and return them when they're done. When a student
requests a room, the clerk decreases this number. When a student releases a room, the clerk increases this number. The room can be used
for as long as desired, and so it is not possible to book rooms ahead of time.
In this scenario the front desk count-holder represents a counting semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent
processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in this scenario is initially 10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room,
they are granted access, and the value of the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next student comes, it drops to 8, then 7 and so on.
If someone requests a room and the current value of the semaphore is 0,[3] they are forced to wait until a room is freed (when the count
is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used to select the
one who will occupy the room (like FIFO or randomly picking one). And of course, a student needs to inform the clerk about releasing their
room only after really leaving it, otherwise, there can be an awkward situation when such student is in the process of leaving the room
(they are packing their textbooks, etc.) and another student enters the room before they leave it.
When used to control access to a pool of resources, a semaphore tracks only how many resources are free; it does not keep track of which
of the resources are free. Some other mechanism (possibly involving more semaphores) may be required to select a particular free resource.
The paradigm is especially powerful because the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions.
The librarian above may turn the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining, or may place a sign that says the
rooms are very busy when most of the rooms are occupied.
The success of the protocol requires applications to follow it correctly. Fairness and safety are likely to be compromised
(which practically means a program may behave slowly, act erratically, hang or crash) if even a single process acts incorrectly. This
includes:
requesting a resource and forgetting to release it;
releasing a resource that was never requested;
holding a resource for a long time without needing it;
using a resource without requesting it first (or after releasing it).
Even if all processes follow these rules, multi-resource deadlock may still occur when there are different resources managed by different
semaphores and when processes need to use more than one resource at a time, as illustrated by the dining philosophers problem.
Counting semaphores are equipped with two operations, historically denoted as P and V (see § Operation names for alternative names).
Operation V increments the semaphore S, and operation P decrements it.
The value of the semaphore S is the number of units of the resource that are currently available. The P operation wastes time or sleeps
until a resource protected by the semaphore becomes available, at which time the resource is immediately claimed. The V operation is the
inverse: it makes a resource available again after the process has finished using it. One important property of semaphore S is that its
value cannot be changed except by using the V and P operations.
A simple way to understand wait (P) and signal (V) operations is:
wait: Decrements the value of semaphore variable by 1. If the new value of the semaphore variable is negative, the process executing wait
is blocked (i.e., added to the semaphore's queue). Otherwise, the process continues execution, having used a unit of the resource.
signal: Increments the value of semaphore variable by 1. After the increment, if the pre-increment value was negative (meaning there are
processes waiting for a resource), it transfers a blocked process from the semaphore's waiting queue to the ready queue.
Many operating systems provide efficient semaphore primitives that unblock a waiting process when the semaphore is incremented. This means
that processes do not waste time checking the semaphore value unnecessarily.
The counting semaphore concept can be extended with the ability to claim or return more than one "unit" from the semaphore, a technique
implemented in Unix. The modified V and P operations are as follows, using square brackets to indicate atomic operations, i.e., operations
which appear indivisible from the perspective of other processes:
